# Stopwatch Application
This project is a simple stopwatch web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The stopwatch can be started, stopped, and reset, and displays time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. The Start button is disabled after the first click to prevent multiple starts, and it is re-enabled when the timer is reset.
